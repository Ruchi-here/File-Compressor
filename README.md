# File Compressor using Huffman Coding

The File Compressor using Huffman Coding is a software tool that enables efficient compression of files by utilizing the Huffman coding algorithm.

This algorithm assigns shorter binary codes to frequently occurring characters or patterns in the file, resulting in a reduced file size without sacrificing data integrity.

## Features

**Compression:** The file compressor analyzes the content of the input file and constructs a Huffman tree, which represents the optimal coding scheme based on character or pattern frequencies. 

It then replaces the original characters or patterns with their corresponding Huffman codes, generating a compressed version of the file.

**Decompression:**
The file compressor also provides a decompression feature, allowing users to reverse the compression process. 
By utilizing the Huffman tree, the compressed file can be restored to its original form without any data loss.

## How to Use

1. Download and install the File Compressor using Huffman Coding.

2. Launch the application.

3. Select the file(s) you wish to compress.

4. Click on the "Run" button to initiate the compression process. 


## Benefits

**Efficient Compression:** Huffman coding assigns shorter codes to frequently occurring characters or patterns, resulting in effective file size reduction.

**Data Integrity:** The compression process is lossless, ensuring that the original file can be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed version.

**Versatility:** The file compressor can be used with various file types, making it suitable for compressing a wide range of documents, images, and other data.

**Storage and Bandwidth Optimization:** Compressed files occupy less space on storage devices, enabling users to store more data. Additionally, the reduced file size facilitates faster file transfers, making it ideal for sharing files over networks or the internet.
